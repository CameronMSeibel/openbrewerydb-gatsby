## About

Open Brewery DB is a free dataset and API with public information on breweries, cideries, brewpubs, and bottleshops. The goal of Open Brewery DB is to maintain an open-source, community-driven dataset and provide a public API. It is our belief that public information should be freely accessible for the betterment of the beer community and the happiness of web developers and data analysts.
